## Why Use a CubPack.org Free Subdomain? 

Having a custom domain makes your pack's website look more official and easier to find, but registering a Domain Costs $20+ per year and must be renewed or the domain can be lost. 

You already have enough to deal with running a pack, why add DNS to the list? With cubpack.org you can have your own _mypack_.cubpack.org subdomain free.
